## Comparable Interface

The `Comparable` interface in Java is used to order the objects of a user-defined class.
It contains only one method, `compareTo(Object)`, which provides a single sorting sequence.
This interface is part of the `java.lang` package.
1. Create your class
2. Implement Comparable \<YourClassName or other Generic>
3. Override `compareTo` method
